                    <h2>Building Microservices with Dropwizard, MongoDB & Docker</h2>
                    <p>Microservices architecture has become increasingly popular in recent years as it offers a number
                        of
                        benefits over traditional monolithic architecture. Dropwizard is a popular Java framework for
                        building microservices, and it is often used in combination with MongoDB and Docker to create a
                        scalable and efficient microservices-based application.

                        Dropwizard provides a simple and lightweight framework for building microservices that can be
                        deployed quickly and easily. It also has built-in support for various components such as Jetty
                        for
                        serving HTTP requests, Jackson for JSON serialization, and Metrics for monitoring and reporting.
                        MongoDB is a NoSQL database that is highly scalable and can handle large amounts of data. It is
                        often used in conjunction with Dropwizard to store and manage data for microservices.

                        Docker is a containerization platform that enables developers to package their applications
                        along
                        with all their dependencies into a single container. This makes it easy to deploy and run
                        applications on different environments without having to worry about dependencies and
                        configurations.

                        By using Dropwizard, MongoDB, and Docker together, developers can create a scalable and
                        efficient
                        microservices-based application that is easy to deploy and manage. The combination of these
                        technologies offers a powerful solution for building modern applications that can handle large
                        amounts of data and traffic.

                    <h2>Dynamically Securing Databases using Hashicorp Vault.</h2>
                    <p> "Dynamically Securing Databases using Hashicorp Vault" is a blog post that discusses how to use
                        Hashicorp Vault to secure a database by dynamically generating database credentials. Here's a
                        brief
                        summary of the blog post:

                        Traditionally, securing a database involves creating a static username and password and storing
                        them
                        in a configuration file. However, this approach has several drawbacks, such as the risk of the
                        credentials being compromised and the difficulty of rotating them. To overcome these issues, the
                        blog post proposes using Hashicorp Vault, a tool for managing secrets and protecting sensitive
                        data.

                        With Hashicorp Vault, you can dynamically generate database credentials on demand, which reduces
                        the
                        risk of the credentials being compromised. When a client requests access to the database, Vault
                        generates a new set of credentials and returns them to the client. The credentials have a
                        limited
                        lifespan, and once they expire, they are automatically revoked by Vault.

                        The blog post also discusses some best practices for using Hashicorp Vault, such as rotating
                        secrets
                        regularly and limiting access to Vault using policies.

                        Overall, "Dynamically Securing Databases using Hashicorp Vault" is a useful resource for anyone
                        looking to improve the security of their database by using dynamic credentials.

                        The blog post provides a step-by-step guide on how to use Hashicorp Vault to secure a MySQL
                        database. The guide covers the following steps:
                        <br><br><br><br>

                        1. Install and configure Hashicorp Vault.<br>
                        2. Enable the database secrets engine in Vault.<br>
                        3. Configure Vault to connect to the MySQL database.<br>
                        4. Create a Vault role and policy that grants access to the MySQL database.<br>
                        5. Generate database credentials using the Vault API.<br>
                        6. Use the generated credentials to connect to the MySQL database.<br>

                    <h2>Adaptive Loading - Improving Web Performance on low-end devices. </h2>
                    <p>
                        "Adaptive Loading - Improving Web Performance on low-end devices" is a blog post that discusses
                        how to improve website performance on low-end devices by using adaptive loading techniques.
                        Here's a brief summary of the blog post:

                        The blog post starts by highlighting the importance of website performance, especially on
                        low-end devices. Slow-loading websites not only frustrate users but also lead to a poor user
                        experience and decreased engagement. Adaptive loading is a technique that can help improve
                        website performance on low-end devices.

                        Adaptive loading involves optimizing a website's resources based on the device's capabilities
                        and network conditions. The blog post provides several adaptive loading techniques that can be
                        used to improve website performance on low-end devices:
                        <br><br><br><br>

                        1. Lazy Loading: This technique involves loading resources only when they are needed. For
                        example, images can be loaded only when they are visible in the viewport.<br>

                        2. Conditional Loading: This technique involves loading resources based on device capabilities.
                        For example, high-resolution images can be loaded only on devices that support high-resolution
                        displays.<br>

                        3. Resource Prioritization: This technique involves prioritizing the loading of critical
                        resources, such as CSS and JavaScript files, over less critical resources, such as images.<br>

                        4. Asset Optimization: This technique involves optimizing resources, such as images and videos,
                        to reduce their file size and improve loading times.<br>

                        The blog post also provides some tips on how to implement these techniques in practice. For
                        example, it suggests using tools like Lighthouse and WebPageTest to measure website performance
                        and identify areas for optimization. It also suggests using a content delivery network (CDN) to
                        improve resource loading times.

                        Overall, "Adaptive Loading - Improving Web Performance on low-end devices" is a useful resource
                        for website developers looking to optimize their website's performance on low-end devices. By
                        using adaptive loading techniques, developers can improve website speed, reduce bounce rates,
                        and provide a better user experience for all users, regardless of their device capabilities.
