# 🎯 **QUIZZ APP - API Project deployed at https://dainty-druid-d6d7c7.netlify.app/**

🧪 This is a simple quiz application built using GitHub and Open Trivia API. The quiz consists of **10 questions related to science**, and the user must answer all the questions correctly to win.

🚀 To get started, the user must first **clone the repository to their local machine**. Once the repository is cloned, the user can navigate to the `index.html` file and open it in their web browser.

🔍 The quiz uses the **Open Trivia API** to generate random questions related to science. The user must select the correct answer from a list of multiple-choice options. If the user answers all 10 questions correctly, they win the quiz. However, if the user answers any question incorrectly, they lose and must try again.

💻 The application is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The JavaScript code handles the quiz logic, including retrieving questions from the API, displaying questions and answer options, and checking the user's answers. The CSS code provides the styling for the quiz, while the HTML code provides the structure and content.

🌟 Overall, this is a **fun and educational quiz application** that allows users to test their knowledge of science while enjoying a game-like experience.
